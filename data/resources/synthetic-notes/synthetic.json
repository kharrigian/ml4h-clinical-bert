Reports stable blood glucose levels and compliance with prescribed medications. No recent changes in systemic health.\n\nVisual acuity measured at 20/30 in both eyes without correction. Dilated fundus examination revealed mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) characterized by microaneurysms and intraretinal hemorrhages. Macular edema was not detected.\n\nPatient counseled on the importance of glycemic control and regular eye examinations to monitor diabetic retinopathy progression. Scheduled for follow-up in six months.\n\n[[[PROBLEM LIST]]]\n[[E11.9: Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications]]\n[OVERVIEW]\nThe patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus without any current complications.\n\n[ASSESSMENT & PLAN]\nStable glycemic control reported.

The procedure involved pneumatic retinopexy with laser photocoagulation. The patient reports a gradual improvement in vision since the surgery.\n\nVisual acuity measured at 20/40 in the affected eye, an improvement from preoperative acuity. Slit-lamp examination revealed a well-healed conjunctival incision site. Fundus examination showed successful reattachment of the retina with no evidence of residual detachment or breaks. The gas bubble from the pneumatic retinopexy is still present, and the patient was advised on proper head positioning to facilitate gas absorption.\n\nPatient instructed to continue prescribed postoperative medications, including topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Emphasized the importance of follow-up appointments for ongoing monitoring.\n\n[[[PROBLEM LIST]]]\n[[H33.4: Retinal detachment with retinal break, unspecified]]\n[OVERVIEW]\nThe patient underwent surgery for retinal detachment with a retinal break.\n\n[ASSESSMENT & PLAN]\nSuccessful reattachment of the retina observed during the postoperative examination.
