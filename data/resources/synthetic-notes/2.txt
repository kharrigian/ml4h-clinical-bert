[[[ENCOUNTER ICD-10 CODES]]]
[[H33.4: Retinal detachment with retinal break, unspecified]]
[[Z98.89: Other specified post-surgical condition]]

[[[PROGRESS NOTE]]]
The patient presented for a postoperative follow-up after undergoing surgery to address retinal detachment. The procedure involved pneumatic retinopexy with laser photocoagulation. The patient reports a gradual improvement in vision since the surgery.

Visual acuity measured at 20/40 in the affected eye, an improvement from preoperative acuity. Slit-lamp examination revealed a well-healed conjunctival incision site. Fundus examination showed successful reattachment of the retina with no evidence of residual detachment or breaks. The gas bubble from the pneumatic retinopexy is still present, and the patient was advised on proper head positioning to facilitate gas absorption.

Patient instructed to continue prescribed postoperative medications, including topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. Emphasized the importance of follow-up appointments for ongoing monitoring.
